The animations and models used for the demos of this project are property of : https://www.mixamo.com/ and not made by its creator.

It is recommended to use a T-Pose animation like the one that can be seen in the project to avoid possible failures. 
Please replace that animation with another with the same name in case you want to use your own.

You will find two demos in the "DEMO" folder:

  -Demo: it is a classic example of GOAP where there are 3 agents interacting with each other. 
   A farmer collects wheat and takes it to a mill, when there is wheat in the mill the baker will make bread and take 
   it to the market, once the market has bread it will be the merchant who puts it up for sale.

  -Demo_Enemy: an enemy will follow the player up to a certain range. 
   Once the player is in a firing range, the enemy will start shooting at him until his life reach 0 and 
   is considered he lost the game.

*These examples are basic simulations, there may be small bugs or some considerations that have not been taken into account, they only show the functionality of the system.

Thank you for using this project and I hope you find it useful in your future video games :)
