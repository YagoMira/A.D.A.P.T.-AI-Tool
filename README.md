It is a tool created as an end-of-degree project for a computer engineering degree based on the videogame-oriented system: GOAP.

## Introduction:
Currently Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that is constantly developing and
improving. Used in many areas such as the video game sector, where through the analysis of
the environment and the ability to adapt to it, behaviors similar to those of humans can be
seen. This project is based on that idea, on developing a tool that allows in a simple way to
be able to create an intelligent behavior and fill those deficiencies that the Unity video game
engine does not offer in a simple way to the user.
To achieve this goal, one of the most innovative systems was integrated in terms of the
creation of AI in video games, known as Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP). This will
allow endow Non-Playable Characters(NPC) to be provided with a set of actions, and depends
on the situation one or other will be executed, with the target of achieve a predetermined goal.
